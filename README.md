# PHYSICS

This is a 2d physics simulation program designed to very accurately detect all collisions in a system. It uses continuous detection method rather than an iterative, so is not designed to run real-time. I currently don't know how well the algorithum scales with objects and simulation time, but there will likely be a point where it takes longer to calculate than the amount of time it is simulating.
